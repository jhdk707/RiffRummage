      Riff Rummager is a fun project based on some early ideas I had in my coding bootcamp. I now
      have a much larger project and expansion of the idea on another app that I am working on,
      however I wanted to keep working on this as a side project. I used to spend HOURS every night
      digging through metalarchives.com, looking for new music and I loved it. Once I found this
      API, I knew that I had to make some kind of project out it, so here we are.
